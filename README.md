# BoringHeroes
A pretty dumb Heroes of the Storm bot.

It uses AForge to get the data from the game and behavior trees for decision making ([Apoc's TreeSharp](https://code.google.com/p/treesharp/)). 

Menu navigation is **not** implemented. 

###DISCLAIMER

This bot was developed for learning CV and as a proof of concept. Using this bot may or may not get you banned, I take no responsibility.
